Various Sudoku Puzzles for a Homebrew DND Campaign

The Puzzles revolve around turning the dials into their correct positions.
There are 3 types of dials: Life, Death, Necron

Life Dial's positions: North-1, East-2, South-3, West-4

            description: While pointing up, 1st character is a Circle with 3 lines to the left & right.
Death Dial's positions: North-5, East-6, South-7, West-8

            description: While pointing up, 1st character is 3 horizontal lines.
Necon Dial's position: 9, It cannot rotate.

            description: Has no pointer & features the Warhammer 40K Necron symbol.

Additionally, cracked dials cannot rotate. These are the set starting clues to complete the puzzles.

The lights around the dials are a red herring. Dials are paired to each other and will randomly turn 
On and Off if one of them is interacted with. While red herrings are typically bad puzzle design, 
there will be clues in the campaign for the players and I wanted the additional programming challenge. 

Players will have 3 attempts to get the correct solution before the alarm is raised.
